.. avro:enum:: CigarOperation

  :symbols: ALIGNMENT_MATCH|INSERT|DELETE|SKIP|CLIP_SOFT|CLIP_HARD|PAD|SEQUENCE_MATCH|SEQUENCE_MISMATCH
  An enum for the different types of CIGAR alignment operations that exist.
  Used wherever CIGAR alignments are used. The different enumerated values
  have the following usage:
  
  * `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`: An alignment match indicates that a sequence can be
    aligned to the reference without evidence of an INDEL. Unlike the
    `SEQUENCE_MATCH` and `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH` operators, the `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`
    operator does not indicate whether the reference and read sequences are an
    exact match. This operator is equivalent to SAM's `M`.
  * `INSERT`: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `I`.
  * `DELETE`: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `D`.
  * `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of
    the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is
    commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long
    segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's 'N'.
  * `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end
    of a read have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the
    majority of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of
    a read. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'S'. Bases that are soft clipped
    will still be stored in the read.
  * `CLIP_HARD`: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of
    a read have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear
    alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed
    (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This
    operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.
  * `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.
    This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.
  * `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned
    sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the
    reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.
  * `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the
    aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence
    mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference). This can
    indicate a SNP or a read error. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'X'.

  :type fragmentLength: null|int
  :field readNumber:

      is unmapped.
  :type alignment: null|LinearAlignment
  :field secondaryAlignment:
    Whether this alignment is secondary. Equivalent to SAM flag 0x100.
      A secondary alignment represents an alternative to the primary alignment
      for this read. Aligners may return secondary alignments if a read can map
      ambiguously to multiple coordinates in the genome.
    
      By convention, each read has one and only one alignment where both
      secondaryAlignment and supplementaryAlignment are false.
  :type secondaryAlignment: null|boolean
  :field supplementaryAlignment:
    Whether this alignment is supplementary. Equivalent to SAM flag 0x800.
      Supplementary alignments are used in the representation of a chimeric
      alignment. In a chimeric alignment, a read is split into multiple
      linear alignments that map to different reference contigs. The first
      linear alignment in the read will be designated as the representative alignment;
      the remaining linear alignments will be designated as supplementary alignments.
      These alignments may have different mapping quality scores.
    
      In each linear alignment in a chimeric alignment, the read will be hard clipped.
      The `alignedSequence` and `alignedQuality` fields in the alignment record will
      only represent the bases for its respective linear alignment.
  :type supplementaryAlignment: null|boolean
  :field alignedSequence:
    The bases of the read sequence contained in this alignment record (equivalent
      to SEQ in SAM).
    
      `alignedSequence` and `alignedQuality` may be shorter than the full read sequence
      and quality. This will occur if the alignment is part of a chimeric alignment,
      or if the read was trimmed. When this occurs, the CIGAR for this read will
      begin/end with a hard clip operator that will indicate the length of the
      excised sequence.
  :type alignedSequence: null|string
  :field alignedQuality:
    The quality of the read sequence contained in this alignment record
      (equivalent to QUAL in SAM).
    
      `alignedSequence` and `alignedQuality` may be shorter than the full read sequence
      and quality. This will occur if the alignment is part of a chimeric alignment,
      or if the read was trimmed. When this occurs, the CIGAR for this read will
      begin/end with a hard clip operator that will indicate the length of the excised sequence.
  :type alignedQuality: array<int>
  :field nextMatePosition:
    The mapping of the primary alignment of the `(readNumber+1)%numberReads`
      read in the fragment. It replaces mate position and mate strand in SAM.
  :type nextMatePosition: null|Position
  :field info:
    A map of additional read alignment information.
  :type info: map<array<string>>

  Each read alignment describes an alignment with additional information
  about the fragment and the read. A read alignment object is equivalent to a
  line in a SAM file.

.. avro:enum:: ExpressionUnits

  :symbols: FPKM|TPM
  Units for expression level.
  FPKM - number of Fragments Per Kilobase of feature length per Million reads
  FPKM is calculated by dividing the fragment count per feature by the total number of reads in millions (FPM - Fragments Per Million).  FPM is then divided by feature length in kilobases to obtain FPKM.
  
  TPM - Transcripts per kilobase Per Million reads
  TPM is calculated by first dividing the fragment/read count by feature length in kilobases (RPK - Reads Per Kilobase).  The count of all RPKs in the sample are then divided by a million to generate a 'per million' scaling value.  For each feature RPK divided by the 'per million' scaling factor generated TPM.
