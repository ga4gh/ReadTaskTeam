BioSample in the GA4GH Schema
------------------------------

The majority of use cases of GA4GH
schema compatible resources will serve to facilitate the retrieval of *molecular
features* (DNA sequence variations, gene expression, protein variants) measured
by performing *experimental* (whole genome sequencing, expression arrays, mass
spectroscopy) in conjunction with *bioinformatics* procedures, appied to a
preparation of target molecules (e.g. DNA, RNA) which has been extracted from a
*biological sample* (e.g. tissue biopsy, single cell from FACS,
environmental sample).

In the GA4GH schema, a *BioSample* represents the main "biological
item" against which molecular variants are referenced.

Individual in the GA4GH Schema
------------------------------

An *Individual* is a GA4GH data object representing a biological instance
(most commonly a human being or other individual organism) on whose *BioSamples*
experimental analyses are performed.
