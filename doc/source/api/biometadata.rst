Biosample in the GA4GH Schema
------------------------------

The majority of use cases of GA4GH
schema compatible resources will serve to facilitate the retrieval of *molecular
features* (DNA sequence variations, gene expression, protein variants) measured
by performing *experimental* (whole genome sequencing, expression arrays, mass
spectroscopy) in conjunction with *bioinformatics* procedures, applied to a
preparation of target molecules (e.g. DNA, RNA) which has been extracted from a
*biological sample* (e.g. tissue biopsy, single cell from FACS,
environmental sample).

In the GA4GH schema, a *Biosample* represents the main "biological
item" against which molecular variants are referenced.

********************************
BioMetadata: *Individual* Object

Individual in the GA4GH Schema
------------------------------

An *Individual* is a GA4GH data object representing a biological instance
(most commonly a human being or other individual organism) on whose *Biosamples*
experimental analyses are performed.

.. _biometadata_BioCharacteristic:

***************************************
BioMetadata: *BioCharacteristic* Object
***************************************

BioCharacteristic in the GA4GH Schema
-------------------------------------

A BioCharacteristic is an object, defining a single phenotype, diagnosis or sample source
through the use of a free text description and a representation by one or
more "ontologyTerms" objects as well as zero or more "negatedOntologyTerms".

.. _biometadata_Characteristics:

*************************************
BioMetadata: *Characteristics* Object
*************************************

Characteristics in the GA4GH Schema
-----------------------------------

Characteristics is a wrapper object with attributes (phenotypes, diseases)
representing lists of BioCharacteristic objects.
