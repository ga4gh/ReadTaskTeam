GA4GH API Definitions
***************************

This page contains links to API descriptions for all GA4GH sub-APIs.
Links to schemas and detailed documentation can be found on each page.

The GA4GH project goals are described in :ref:`apigoals`

The API design is described in :ref:`apidesign`


++++++++++++++++
Variants
++++++++++++++++

Variants are positions of genetic difference in a collection of call sets.
Variants may have standard names, like rs1234.
Each variant identifies a position in a reference genome, a type of variant like SNP,
insertion or deletion, the alternate allele, and the call sets that contain the variant.

Reads

Reads are nucleotide sequences generated by a DNA sequencing instrument, along with quality scores and metadata.
Reads may be aligned to a reference sequence, or unaligned.

:ref:`reads`

Metadata
++++++++++++++++

Metadata are descriptions of datasets and experiments. The other GA4GH APIs contain references to metadata.

:ref:`metadata`
