/**
  These records represent variant annotations such as putative effects
  (also called consequences) and simple prioritization (also called impact). 

  For example, an annotation can represent a frame shift variant (having 
  a high impact) or a synonimous variant (having a low impact).

  Note: These records are based on annotated VCF files, such as those produced
        by SnpEff or ENSEMBL's VEP, having VCF INFO tags 'EFF' and 'CSQ' 
        respectively.
        As such, some of the standards refered to may not be followed 
        strictly. For instance, HGVS nomenclature suggests that 
        "silent changes" are represented as "p.=", but the equal sign is 
        not allowed in VCF fields. In these cases an alternative (sometimes 
        discurraged) representation may be used.

  GAEffect: Putative effect (or consequence) of a variant

  Due to Avro restrictions, terms starting with number (such as 5_prime_* or 
  3_prime) are converted to letters (FIVE_PRIME_*, THREE_PRIME_*)

  Order:
    Terms are order by 'estimated' biological impact. This means that a term 
    appearing at the beginnig of the list is assumeed to have a higher impact 
    on protein function than ones appearing at the end of the list (e.g. 
    FRAMESHIFT_VARIANT is assumed to have a higher impact than 
    SYNONYMOUS_VARIANT).

    This order is used to sort results, thus showing "more important" results 
    first.
