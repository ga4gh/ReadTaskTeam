/**
  This protocol represents generic annotations
  Annotations are be roughly divided in 3 'catagories':

    * Variant annotations: Typically this include putative effects, such
      as 'non_synonymous', 'stop_gained', etc.

    * Gene / transcript annotations: Annotaions releated to genes or 
      transcripts might include Gene-Set, Gene Ontology, Pathway, identifiers 
      (such as Uniprot IDs), expression by tissue, etc.

    * Gene region annotations: These may include conservation scores, protein 
      domains, transcription factor binding sites, etc.
